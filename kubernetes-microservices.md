# Project 1: Containerized Web Application Deployment

## Detailed Project Description
This project aimed to containerize an existing web application to streamline deployment and ensure consistency across different environments.

### 1. The Business Challenge
- Deploying applications across different environments often leads to inconsistencies due to varying dependencies and configurations. Containerization solves this by packaging an application and its dependencies together.

### 2. The Technical Challenge
- The challenge was to containerize a web application using Docker, making it easy to deploy and scale.
- Requirements included creating a Dockerfile, building a Docker image, and running containers.

### 3. The Process
- Created a Dockerfile to specify the application's environment, dependencies, and build steps.
- Built a Docker image from the Dockerfile.
- Deployed the Docker container using Docker Compose for easier orchestration.
- Technologies used included Docker and Docker Compose.

### 4. The Results
- Achieved consistent application deployment across multiple environments.
- Reduced setup time for new instances of the application by over 50%.

# Project 2: Microservices with Kubernetes

## Detailed Project Description
This project focused on deploying a microservices-based application using Kubernetes, enhancing scalability and fault tolerance.

### 1. The Business Challenge
- As applications grow, they often become complex and hard to manage. Microservices architecture, combined with container orchestration, provides a scalable and manageable solution.

### 2. The Technical Challenge
- The challenge involved breaking down an existing monolithic application into microservices and deploying them using Kubernetes.
- Requirements included creating Docker containers for each microservice and orchestrating them using Kubernetes.

### 3. The Process
- Broke down the existing monolithic application into multiple microservices.
- Containerized each microservice using Docker.
- Created Kubernetes manifests (YAML files) for each microservice.
- Deployed the microservices onto a Kubernetes cluster, using kubectl for orchestration.
- Technologies involved were Docker and Kubernetes.

### 4. The Results
- Achieved greater application scalability and resilience.
- Enabled independent scaling and updating of individual microservices, leading to more efficient resource usage and quicker deployments.
